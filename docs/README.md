# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This folder collects our core program/project management process documents for the OctoAcme team.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme runs projects using a customer-first, iterative approach that prioritizes:
- Small, testable increments
- Clear ownership and responsible roles
- Measurable outcomes and continuous feedback

The high-level phases include:
- **Project Initiation:** Validate needs, define measurable outcomes, align stakeholders, create a lightweight plan.
- **Planning:** Break work into deliverables, prioritize backlog, estimate scope, document dependencies and risks.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Manage delivery using project boards, standups, PR conventions, thorough testing, and metric dashboards.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardized checklists, CI/CD, incident playbooks, and rollback procedures for safe, effective launches.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, communicate status, and escalate issues through clear paths.
- **Retrospective & Improvement:** Capture learnings and continuously evolve processes through actionable items.
- **Roles/Personas:** Clearly defined responsibilities for Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.
